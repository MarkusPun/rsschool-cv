### Briefly About Myself:  
I took a great interest in programming since 6th class. 
In high school I started working with HTML and CSS, I am also good at drawing and working with graphics, 
so I am interested in the profession of front-end developer.
I think I can develop my potential in this business and become a qualified specialist.
I am now in my second year at BSUIR, specialising as a radio electronics engineer.
